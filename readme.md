# Demise By LLM
This is an open source game inspired by discord's "Death By AI" that I coded up.

## Usage
Start up the server. It starts on `ipaddress=0.0.0.0` and port `1337`.

The client takes one argument which is the ip address of the server.

## Playing
There are 2 commands: `cmd.start` and `cmd.end`

## Bugs
There are a lot

The server blows up when someone sends too much data
